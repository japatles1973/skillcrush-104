			<h4>Organize your site before you begin</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
          <p>  When you begin a little pre planning can a long way. Below if a list of things to consider brfore you start. If you get or have questions, you can find many of the answers on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" alt="W3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a>. All kinds of questions can be answered here.</p>

			
			<p>As for your page design. If you are programming and designing, you need to learn to separate the two.
            </p>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Plan your site with a wireframe to determine the number of pages and how they will connect to one another</li>
                	<li>Start with the layout in a design program like Photoshop</li>
                	<li>Plan you colors, fonts, themes, and overall look of the site with style tiles</li>
                    <li>Pull together all of you images, fonts and copy</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <p> Working these things out ahead of time make it much easier to concentrate on code when you are ready to begin.</p>
